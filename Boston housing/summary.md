Assume that a dataset contains five data points and a model made the following predictions for the target variable:

| True Value | Prediction |
| :-------------: | :--------: |
| 3.0 | 2.5 |
| -0.5 | 0.0 |
| 2.0 | 2.1 |
| 7.0 | 7.8 |
| 4.2 | 5.3 |
*Would you consider this model to have successfully captured the variation of the target variable? Why or why not?* 

Run the code cell below to use the `performance_metric` function and calculate this model's coefficient of determination.

### Implementation: Fitting a Model
Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.

For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.
  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.
- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.
- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.
  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.
  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.
- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.
  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. 
  - Assign the `GridSearchCV` object to the `'grid'` variable.
